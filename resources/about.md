## How it works

There are a lot of awesome social justice resources circulating online to help people take action and make positive change in their communities. Unfortunately, many of these resources are in the form of images of text, which can present accessibility barriers for a bunch of folks, including those who are blind, have learning disabilities, or primarily speak a different language.

**a11ies.info** exists to help you create and share transcripts of key resources, so everyone can access them. We host your transcripts at short, customizable URLs so you can easily share accessible, text-only versions of the resources you love.

- **Transcribe:** Have a resource you want to transcribe, or want to volunteer to transcribe a requested resource?
- **Request:** Have a resource you want transcribed? Fill out this form with a link to the resource and one of our volunteers will transcribe it for you.

- **Guidance:** there are also a lot of ways to make your resources accessible by default. Check out our Resources section for tools, best practices, and other info to help you make your movement accessible to all.
